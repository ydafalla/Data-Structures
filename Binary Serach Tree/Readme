The goal of this project to to implement the binary serach tree. The program reads integer numbers from a given data file
(data.txt) one at a time and inserts them into the binary serach tree. The binary search tree is implemented using children
pointer implementation. After reading data from the file, the program have an interface asks the user to choose 
one of the following options:

1- Insert (to insert a new element to the BST)
2- DeleteMin (delete the minimum element in the BST)
3- DeleteMax (delete the maximum element in the BST)
4- Delete (delete a specific element in the BST)
5- FindMin (prints the minimum element in the BST)
6- FindMax (prints the maximum element in the BST)
7- Preorder (prints out the elements of the BST using preorder traversal)
8- Inorder (prints out the elements of the BST using inorder traversal)
9- Postorder (prints out the elements of the BST using postorder traversal)
10- Exit
