//This is probably the hardest data structure i have to implment

The goal of this project to implement the 2-3 tree. The programs reads integer numbers from a data file (data.txt) and inserts
them one at a time into a 2-3 tree. Duplicate elements are not allowed. After reading the data from the file the program displays
an application interface that ask the user to choose one of the following options:

1- Insert (insert a user specified input to the 2-3 tree)
2- DeleteMin (delete the smallest element from the 2-3 tree)
3- DeleteMax (delete the max element from the 2-3 tree)
4- FindMin (prints the minimum element of the 2-3 tree)
5- FindMax (prints the maximum element of the 2-3 tree)
6- Find (searches for a user specified input in the 2-3 tree and prints a message according to whether the element was found or not)
7- Delete (delete a user specified input from the 2-3 tree)
8- LevelOrder (prints the leaf elements of the 2-3 tree from left to right)
9- Exit (exits the application)
