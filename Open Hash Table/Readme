The goal of this project is to implement an open hash table with chaining using a doubly linked list. Data are to be read from
a file (data.txt). The first element of the file is the size of the hash table. The rest of the file contains the strings
that should be inserted into the hash table seperated by a space. After building the structure the program asks the user to 
choose one of the following options:
1- Insert (inserts x to the hash table when it's not found. Insertion must be done at the beginning of the chain.)
2- Delete (deletes x from the hash table)
3- Find (checks whether x is in the hash table)
4- Print (print out all the elements of the hash table)
5- Exit
