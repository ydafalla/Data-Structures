The goal of this project is to implement the Max-Skew Heap using the pointer based implementation. The program reads the 
integer numbers from a data file (data.txt) and inserts each number to the Max-Skew Heap. After reading the data from the file
the program displays an application interface with the following options:
 
 1- Insert (insert a user entered element to the skew heap)
 2- DeleteMax (deletes the maximum element from the skew heap)
 3- PreOrder (prints the elements of the skew heap using preorder traversal)
 4- InOrder (prints the elements of the skew heap using inorder traversal)
 5- PostOrder (prints the elements of the skew heap using postorder traversal)
 6- LevelOrder (prints the elementos the skew heap using Levelorder traversal)
 7- Exit
