The goal of this project is to implement the minmax heap and the maxmin heap using the array based implementation. The program
reads integer numbers from a data file (data.txt) and inserts each number into a MinMax heap (and MaxMin heap). 
The bottom-up approach is used to insert elements to the Minmax heap and the topdown approach is used to insert elements to the 
Maxmin heap. After insertion of the elements the an application interace will be displayed with the following options:
1- Insert (insert an element to the minmax (maxmin) heap
2- DeletMin (deletes the minimum element in the minmax (maxmin) heap)
3- findMin (prints the minimum element in the minmax (maxmin) heap)
4- findMax (prints the maximum element in the minmax (maxmin) heap)
5- deleteMax (deletes the maximum element in the minmax (maxmin) heap)
6- LevelOrder (should print all the elements of the minmax (maxmin) heap using level order traversal each level in a separate line)
7- Exit

To run the program execute the following command in the terminal after you make the file
./output minmax (for minmax heap)
./output maxmin (for maxmin heap)
