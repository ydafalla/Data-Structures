The goal of this project is to implement two closed hash tables with different open addressing collision resolution 
schemes (Quadratic probing and Double Hashing). The number of buckets in each hash table is considered to be 53. The data
inserted to the two hash tables is integers and is to be read from a file (data.txt). Duplicate elements are not allowed. The 
load factor of the table should be printed after each insert and delete operation. After reading the data the program asks the 
user to choose one of the following options:

1- Insert
2- Delete
3- Find
4- Print
5- Exit
