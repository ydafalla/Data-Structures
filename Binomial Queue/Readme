The goal of this project is to write code for a pointer-based implementation of Binomial Queue. Numbers are read from a data file (data.txt) of integers and
each number was inserted into a of Binomial Queue.

 After that, your program should have a simple menu like this:

 1-Insert: Inserts an element x to the Binomial Queue
 2-Deletemin: Deletes the minimum element of the binomail queue
 3-Findmin: Prints the minimum element in the binomial queue
 4-Print: Prints the different binomail trees that constitutes the binomial queue
